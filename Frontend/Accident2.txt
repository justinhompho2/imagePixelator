Accidentally pushed my changes to main instead of this branch.
I'm writing this so that I can make a pull request for main anyways.
I only added frontend elements.

Summary of work:
-Added remaining elements from figma mockup
-Switched from inline-block to grid-row system which is better for window resizing(more reactive)
- Added placeholder images to display how the website would look after functionality is implemented
- Started work on the .js file adding button functionality...
